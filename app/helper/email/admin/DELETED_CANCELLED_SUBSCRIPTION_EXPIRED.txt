Blot did not delete cancelled user account (safe mode)

Blot would have deleted user {{email}} because they had cancelled their subscription and their subscription expired on {{subscriptionExpiredOn}}, but account deletion is currently running in safe mode as a no-op while we verify production behavior.

To actually delete this account manually, run:

ssh blot
login
node scripts/user/remove {{email}}
