<h1>Google Docs</h1>

<p>Supports files created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs">Google Docs</a>. You must sync your folder with <a href="/how/sync/google-drive">Google Drive</a> in order to publish Google Docs.</p>

<h2>Metadata</h2>

<p>Blot reads <a href="/how/metadata">metadata</a> at the very top of your Google Doc. For example:</p>

<pre class="md"><code>Title: October Newsletter
Tags: announcements, fall

The rest of your post goes here.
</code></pre>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Insert photos directly in Google Docs using the menu <span class="ui-action">Insert</span> then <span class="ui-action">Image</span>, or by dragging and dropping an image file into the document. They will be downloaded and stored beside the post. Alt and title text are preserved if they are part of the image in Google Docs.</p>

<h2>Headings</h2>

<p>Use the Google Docs heading styles (<code>Heading 1</code>, <code>Heading 2</code>, etc.) for in-post structure.</p>

<h2>Text formatting</h2>

<p>Bold, italic, superscript, subscript, underline and strikethrough text are preserved. Other inline styles are removed so the post inherits your theme's typography.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>Links in your Google Doc are cleaned automatically. Google's tracking redirects are removed so each link on your blog points directly to the original URL.</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>Use the Google Docs feature <span class="ui-action">Insert</span> then <span class="ui-action">List</span> to create lists. These are preserved in the published post.</p>

<h2>Tables</h2>

<p>Use the Google Docs feature <span class="ui-action">Insert</span> then <span class="ui-action">Table</span> to create tables. These are preserved in the published post.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>Use a single-celled tables to mark up code blocks in your document. For example:</p>
<p><span class="ui-action">Insert</span> then <span class="ui-action">Table</span> then <span class="ui-action">1 x 1</span></p>

<p>If you create a double celled table, with two rows, you can specify the language of the code in the first cell to enable syntax highlighting:</p>
<p><span class="ui-action">Insert</span> then <span class="ui-action">Table</span> then <span class="ui-action">2 x 1</span></p>

  <strong>Tip:</strong> To avoid Google Docs’ “smart quotes” (curly quotes), press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> immediately after typing quotation marks. This will undo the automatic replacement of your straight quotes with curly quotes.
</div>

<p>This follows the convention of and is compatible with the popular <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/code_blocks/100740430168">Code Blocks</a> app for Google Docs. You do not need to install the app to use code blocks in Google Docs with Blot.</p>
